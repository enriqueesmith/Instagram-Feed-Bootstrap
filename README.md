# Instagram-Feed-Bootstrap
Simple Instagram Feed built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 

The navigation buttons allow the user to switch between seeing the Instagram Feed photos 
without any captions and seeing the Instagram Feed photos with captions, likes and hashtags.

No JavaScript was used therefore the Modal and Dropdown menu in the top right 
corner are simply for asthetic purposes and do not have functionality.
